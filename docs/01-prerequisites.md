# Prerequisites

## Draft: Assumptions

Assumptions for the labs:

- Ubuntu latest LTS
- Python? Conda?
- What assumptions are in the commands we're writing?
    - ports
    - sudo access (probably a reasonable assumption though)
    - assuming linux dist (make notes for macs)
    - gcloud use option -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 to make localhost to pass no credentials over http (insecure)
        - Windows??
- Running on a server with a real domain name pointing to it
